# PoW + Approval Voting

This repository contains a simulation of a hybrid consensus mechanism combining **Proof-of-Work (PoW)** with a lightweight **approval cluster** to reduce energy consumption with a negligible decrease in decentralization. This work supports findings proposed in our IEEE paper.

## Overview

We propose a two-phase consensus model:
1. **Mining Phase (PoW)** — Traditional block mining using difficulty-based hash computation.
2. **Approval Phase** — A probabilistic voting mechanism by weighted nodes simulating a decentralized review process.

The simulation compares energy usage of pure PoW vs. our hybrid design across multiple rounds.
